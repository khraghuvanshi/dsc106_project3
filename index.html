    <h3>About this Visualization</h3>
    <div id="write-up">
      <p>Our development process began with extracting and processing sensor data
      from the PADS Parkinson’s Disease Smartwatch dataset. We focused on the
      movement data recorded from the left and right wrists across various
      tasks. This setup was challenging because of the nested structure of the
      data. Each subject performed up to 11 different tasks, with separate
      sensor files for the left and right wrists. Extracting the relevant
      accelerometer data required iterating over each subject and task, locating
      the correct sensor file, reading the time-series data, and isolating the
      x, y, and z-axis acceleration channels. We calculated the standard
      deviation of these accelerometer readings across the three axes as a proxy
      measure for tremor intensity, which is a common approach in wearable
      sensor analysis.</p>
        <p>
      After obtaining tremor severity for each wrist and task,
      we moved to baseline normalization. The idea was to use the "Relaxed" task
      as a baseline for each wrist and calculate the difference in tremor
      severity for other tasks relative to this baseline. The process of
      computing the severity difference involved merging the baseline severity
      back into the tremor dataset and calculating the difference for each
      task-wrist combination. 
    </p>
      <p>
      We chose a bar chart with bar height representing
      tremor severity because it is an intuitive and highly effective visual
      encoding for magnitude comparisons. Bar charts leverage length/height as
      the primary visual channel to represent quantitative data. Human
      perception is highly attuned to comparing lengths along a common baseline,
      which makes it easier for viewers to accurately compare the differences in
      tremor severity across conditions. Each condition is plotted along the
      x-axis, making it easier for users to compare groups side by side.
      Additionally, color hue is used to reinforce condition identity, with each
      condition being assigned a unique color. Additionally, horizontal
      gridlines were added to the chart to assist with estimating the tremor
      severity along the y-axis, supporting magnitude comparison. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To enhance the exploratory analysis, we also incorporated interactivity 
      to allow the user
      to filter the data along two key attributes.
      The Task Selection Dropdown
      allows the user to choose a specific movement task (e.g., Relaxed, Hold
      Weight, etc.) to see how tremor severity varies by condition during that
      task. The dropdown menu was used to reduce clutter, as it deals with 11
      tasks. 
      The Condition Checkboxes allow users to select specific diagnostic
      groups (conditions) such as Healthy, Parkinson's, Atypical Parkinsonism,
      etc. This is important as users may be interested in comparing specific
      subsets like Parkinson's vs. Healthy, reducing visual clutter by excluding
      less relevant conditions. 
    </p>
      
      <p>
      Additionally, we also implemented a tooltip that
      appears when the user hovers over a bar. The tooltip displays the
      condition, task description, and maximum tremor severity for that
      condition and task. This provides more context and detailed information
      without cluttering the chart. Bar highlighting was also used to improve
      user focus. When hovering over a bar, the other bars have a visual fading
      effect while the hovered bar remains fully visible. This directs the
      user's attention to eh selected condition and improves visual clarity when
      comparing values. 
    </p>
      <p>
        In summary, our development process involved extracting
      and processing sensor data, computing tremor severity, and normalizing it
      against a baseline to facilitate meaningful comparisons. By leveraging a
      bar chart as our primary visualization, we ensured an intuitive and
      effective representation of tremor severity across tasks and conditions.
      Interactive elements such as the task selection dropdown, conditions
      checkbox, tooltips, and bar highlighting further enhance usability,
      allowing users to explore the data dynamically and focus on specific
      comparisons. These design choices collectively create a clear and
      informative visualization that supports both detailed analysis and broad
      insights into tremor severity variations across different movement tasks
      and diagnostic groups.
